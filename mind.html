				<h2>The Mind</h2>
				<p>Please consider this brief interpretation of the mind and how it works. I trust that it will illustrate a more comprehensive picture of my thought process and therefore, produce a finer understanding of who I am.</p>
				<h3 class="headback">Background</h3>
				<p class="p-background">The mind is highly complex, but through the intentional formation of positive habits, it can be radically changed and improved.</p>
				<div id="continue-reading">
					<button onclick="background()" class="expand">continue reading<i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i></button>
				</div>
				<div id="backgroundText" style="display: none">
					<p>Everyone has a unique belief system, a framework for making sense of the world around them. This mesh of information consists of emotions, ideas, opinions, values, personal experiences, learned knowledge, mental models, and much more. Over time, this builds upon itself layer by layer, growing increasingly complex and dynamic. Highly malleable and infinitely configurable, it continually reorganizes itself by forming and strengthening new connections.<br></br>
					It’s a network after all, and like other networks, it’s more than the sum of its parts. By adding, removing, or altering core components, minor actions cascade into grand changes that have exponential effects on your cognitive abilities.</p>
				</div>
				<button onclick="identify()" class="expand">Identify<i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i></button>
				<div id="identifyText" style="display: none">
					<p>Stay vigilant and question everything. Make it a practice to catch thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors that seem negative, contradictory, lack evidence, or may contain bias. Those identified as problematic are subject to additional scrutiny.</p>
				</div> 
				<button onclick="reflect()" class="expand">Reflect<i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i></button>
				<div id="reflectText" style="display: none"> 
					<p>Confront yourself. Play around with the idea that you may be wrong, ignorant, or misguided. Look at the issue from many different perspectives. Do everything within reason to build a case against it.</p>
				</div>  
				<button onclick="act()" class="expand">Act<i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i></button>
				<div id="actText" style="display: none"> 
					<p>Remain open and understand that it’s ok to change your mind. At this point, the challenge is to come to terms with the results. Accept the evidence, make the appropriate updates to your belief system, and change your behavior; or develop the excuses, justifications, and distractions that build barriers and retreat into a life of contradiction and denial.</p>
				</div> 
				<h3 class="headcon">Conclusion</h3>
				<p class="p-conclusion">This distillation of gradually accumulated knowledge and experience has solidified into a robust decision-making tool.</p>
				<div id="continue-reading">
				<button onclick="conclusion()" class="expand">continue reading<i class="fas fa-angle-down" id="conclusion"></i></button>
				</div>
				<div id="conclusionText" style="display: none">
					<p>These concepts may sound like common sense and the procedures, well, robotic, but they are nevertheless powerful in their simplicity. In fact, with enough practice, this basic model can be internalized, expanded upon, and applied to nearly every aspect of life. It becomes the filter through which the world is perceived; a lens that focuses the relevant and important while protecting against the negative and harmful. In time, there will exist clarity where before was fog.<br></br>
					I attribute much of this insight to the tireless effort of repeated questioning and reflection of personal experience over an extended period of time. My diligent commitment and sheer tenacity have lead to a significant improvement in the way I think, make decisions, and solve problems, but to my surprise, the biggest gains have been to empathy, openness, and what I can only describe as wisdom.</p>
