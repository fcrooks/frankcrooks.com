				<h2>The Mind</h2>
				<p>Everyone has a unique belief system, a framework for making sense of the world around them. This mesh of information consists of a multitude of emotions, ideas, opinions, values, personal experiences, learned knowledge, mental models, and much more. Over time, it builds upon itself layer by layer, and the whole system grows increasingly complex and dynamic. It’s the most powerful tool at our disposal, and it requires dedicated care to maintain. </p>
				<h2>Add/Remove/Edit</h2>
				<p>The mind is incredibly plastic. It’s a network that’s infinitely configurable, and like other networks, it’s more than the sum of its parts. By adding, removing, or editing core components, small actions cascade into big changes that have exponential effects on your cognitive abilities.</p>
				<h2>But How?</h2>
				<p><h3>Identify</h3> Be vigilant and question everything. Make it a practice to catch thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors that seem negative, contradictory, lack evidence, or may contain bias. Those identified as problematic are subject to additional scrutiny.</p> 
				<p><h3>Review</h3> Confront yourself. Play around with the idea that you may be wrong, ignorant, or misguided. Look at the issue from many different perspectives. Do everything within reason to build a case against it.</p>  
				<p><h3>Action</h3> At this point, the challenge is to remain open and understand that it’s ok to change your mind. Accept the evidence and make the appropriate updates to your belief system, or develop excuses, justifications, and distractions to build barriers and retreat into a life of contradiction and denial.</p> 
				<p>*With enough practice, this basic model can be internalized, expanded, and applied to nearly every aspect of life. It becomes the filter, or lens through which the world is perceived, focusing the relevant and important while protecting against the negative and harmful. Soon there will exist clarity where before was fog.</p>
				<h2>My Mind</h2>
				<p>Over the last decade, I’ve gradually developed my own personal system, actively forming and refining habits that will further my goals. I’ve noticed a significant improvement in the way I think, make decisions, and solve problems, but to my surprise, the biggest gains have been to my empathy, openness, and what I would describe as overall wisdom. By diligently committing myself to lifelong betterment I’ve become highly confident, ambitious, and fearless of challenge.</p>
