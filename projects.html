				<h2>The Cost of Aging</h2>
				<p>Everyone grows old and eventually dies. We reluctantly accept that fate and spend great sums of money attempting to delay it, often extending the suffering we intended to alleviate. But what if there’s a better way? Scientists today are making tremendous advances in longevity research, tangible breakthroughs that call into question our entire understanding of aging. While there are plenty of skeptics, the potential of this field is nothing short of revolutionary, and even if the gains are small, I see an enormous opportunity. 
				<br><br>
				This is the first phase of a much larger project focused on aging and death where I will explore a variety of data, research, and cutting-edge ideas. Along with the subsequent results, I will present what I think is a much more effective way to allocate our collective resources and improve countless lives in the process.</p>

				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p>From the data, we can conclude that disease is above and beyond the leading cause of death, with the top two causes (heart disease and cancer) accounting for more than the other top 10 combined. Death from all diseases disproportionately affects older adult populations where the older half (55+) is five times more likely to die of disease. Specifically, heart disease and cancer deaths occur almost exclusively in the 50+ range.
				<br><br>
				While it may come as no surprise that older populations are more likely to get sick and die, I hope to have illuminated just how stark that reality is. Later, I’ll take a deeper look at the connection between age and disease, revealing just how critical longevity research is. But in the next phase I’d like to focus on money, how much is being spent and where it’s going.
