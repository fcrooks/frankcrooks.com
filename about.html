				<h2>At a Glance</h2>
				<p> The world is changing rapidly, and there’s never been a better opportunity to make an impact. Whether it be as part of an established organization, a small team, or through my own entrepreneurial endeavors, I’m passionate about contributing to meaningful projects and important causes. With a professional background in operations, I’ve increasingly branched out to cultivate a variety of interests in many different fields. I’m constantly adding useful skills and knowledge and hope to combine it all to solve some of the world’s most critical problems.</p>
				<h2>Areas of Interest</h2>
				<h3>Education</h3> <p>It’s not about just throwing more money into public schools or cutting tuition costs. Education needs a radical redesign for the 21st century. I’m interested in creating universal access to information and encouraging holistic, lifelong learning.</p>  
				<h3>Philanthropy</h3> <p>In order to do good in the world, we have to be better than the stereotypically bloated and bureaucratic nonprofit. The cause needs to be objectively valuable, and the organization or investor should be as transparent as possible. The impact and effectiveness should be thoroughly supported by evidence and reason.</p> 
				<h3>Emerging Technology</h3> <p>From innovative biomaterials and sustainable energy to AI, blockchain, and the future of dispersed collaboration, no other sector has as much potential for both positive and negative results. It’s our challenge, and obligation, to use it for the benefit of humankind.</p>     
				<h3>Public Benefit Corporations</h3> <p>If an organization cannot produce their products and services in an ethical manner then it should cease to exist. The conveniences of cheap material goods are simply not worth the exploitation of our people and planet. Many alternatives already exist and with increased demand more replacements will be created. We can hold organizations to a higher standard with the choices we make everyday.</p>
				<h2>Personality Traits</h2>
				<h3>Genuine</h3>
				<p>To be genuine is to be frank. Unfailingly open, honest, and straight-forward, of high integrity and strong character. A powerful quality that builds trust and forges deeper relationships. To be <i>Frank</i> is to be genuine.</p>    
				<h3>Thoughtful</h3>
				<p>Hindsight is 20/20, but that doesn’t mean foresight has to be 20/200. By attempting to view the world from many different perspectives and taking the time to consider all available information, we can greatly enhance the quality of the picture and make better decisions. In the long run, this saves time, effort, and valuable resources.</p>  
				<h3>Empathetic</h3>
				<p>Normally, people tend to focus inward, framing events and interactions around themselves as if they’re the main character in the film, Me! But outward attention picks up on hidden details, leads to less bias and more accurate comprehension, and improves overall social intelligence.</p>
				<p>But there is another, possibly greater benefit. In practicing empathy, the mind builds models of unfamiliar experiences. When imagined in greater detail, these experiences become more clearly understood and the models more useful. The result is a virtual atlas that can be referenced and used to successfully navigate uncharted territory. We can better prepare ourselves to cope with difficult new situations and deal with future adversity.
