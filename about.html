				<h2>What I want to accomplish</h2>
				<p> What I value, admire, and hope to live up to</p>
				<h3>Genuine</h3>
				<p>To be genuine is to be frank. Unfailingly open, honest, and straight-forward, of high integrity and strong character. A powerful quality that builds trust and forges deeper relationships. To be <i>Frank</i> is to be genuine.</p>    
				<h3>Thoughtful</h3>
				<p>Hindsight is 20/20, but that doesn’t mean foresight has to be 20/200. Attempting to view the world from many different perspectives and taking the time to consider all available information, we can greatly enhance the quality of the picture and make better decisions. In the long run, this saves time, effort, and valuable resources.</p>  
				<h3>Empathetic</h3>
				<p>Normally, people tend to focus inward, framing events and interactions around themselves as if they’re the main character in the film, Me! But outward attention picks up on hidden details, leads to less bias and more accurate interpretations, and improves overall social intelligence.</p> 
				<p>But there is another, possibly greater benefit. In practicing empathy, the mind builds models of unfamiliar experiences. When imagined in greater detail, these experiences become more clearly understood and the models more useful. The result is a virtual atlas that can be referenced and used to successfully navigate uncharted territory. We can prepare ourselves to better cope with difficult new situations and deal with future adversity.</p>
				<h3>How I intend to make it happen</h3>  
				<h3>Education</h3> <p>It’s not about just throwing more money into public schools or cutting tuition costs. I’m interested in universal access to information. Education needs a radical redesign for the 21st century. I think it’s important to encourage holistic, lifelong learning in both our children and adults.</p>  
				<h3>Philanthropy</h3> <p>In order to do good in the world, we have to be better than the typical bloated and bureaucratic nonprofit. The cause needs to be objectively valuable and the organization or investor should be as transparent as possible. The impact and effectiveness should be thoroughly supported by evidence and reason.</p> 
				<h3>Emerging Technology</h3> <p>From innovative biomaterials and sustainable energy to AI, blockchain, and the future of dispersed collaboration, no other sector has as much potential for both positive and negative results. It’s our challenge, and obligation, to use it for the benefit of humankind.</p>     
				<h3>Public Benefit Corporations</h3> <p>I subscribe to a simple business model: provide a product or service of (nontrivial) value to society, produce it in a sustainable and eco-friendly way, compensate employees with a livable wage, and invest any profits back into the community. It may seem trivial on a small scale but imagine the impact of every company operating this way. We can realize that goal if we can create enough consumer demand for ethical organizations.</p>
